Information architecture : 
To begin with, I placed my name as a title in the center of my CV website. Just below it, within the header, I included a navigation bar for easy access to each section. At the same level as my name, on the left side of the page, I positioned my profile photo.

Continuing down the left sidebar, after my image, I organized basic information about myself. This section includes my contact details, a brief personal description under "About Me," and a summary of my key skills.

For the main content area in the center, I divided it into two columns. In the left column, I decided to put three sections. Firstly, I provide a detailed overview of my work experience. Following this, I included some of my interests, which highlight areas I’d like to work in, and all my certifications up to the present date and where I studied. In the right column, I placed the remaining two sections. I listed the fields in which I have knowledge and can work. Below this, I included a section that shows the languages I speak and my proficiency level in each.

Finally, at the bottom of my CV website, we can find the footer.



Visual Design :
For the visual design of my CV website, I wanted to have a clean, professional look that reflects both clarity and organization, making the content easy to navigate and visually attractive. I opted for neutral colors, predominantly using shades of gray and white, which adds a sense of elegance and allows the text and images to stand out without distractions.

The header section is designed with a centered title featuring my name, which immediately identifies the website as a personal CV and draws attention to my professional identity. I included a navigation bar below the header, ensuring quick access to each section and allowing users to jump directly to the information they’re looking for. The navigation links change color on hover, adding a subtle interactive element and guiding users as they explore.

At the same level as my name, on the left side of the page, I positioned my profile photo to establish a clear visual association. This sidebar also contains my contact information and personal details in a compact and easy-to-find area, so users can access them quickly without distracting from the main content.

The main content is divided into two columns, each with generous spacing to prevent overcrowding and improve readability. Section headings are highlighted with soft background shapes, adding structure and helping each part stand out. The typeface is straightforward, chosen for readability on screens of all sizes. Overall, this design balances functionality with a modern look, making my CV appear both professional and user-friendly.
